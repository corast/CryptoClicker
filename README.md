# CryptoClicker
Project delivery in a Android Programming course at HIOF.

This is a very simple game, based on the popular game Cookieclicker, But instead of cookies, the game is based on Bitcoin. Not 100% finished, but good enough for grading in a introductory course.
Comments are mostly in norwegian, and code is quite unstructured and messy due to time and complexity of the project at hand.
